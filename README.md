This is a team project for a university course. 

It is our first big experiment with Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Classification and Natural Language Processing.

All the source code is in the Colab file since we utilized Colab T4 GPU acceleretor for the trainings.
The models, params and sub datasets are available as Google Drive files at the time of the upload (might be deleted later for space).
